# Project2-Data-Modeling-Apache-Cassandra
Data Engineer Nanodegree second project

## **Project Idea:**

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

They'd like a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.

## **Project Overview:**
In this project, we are expecting to use skills that are learned on data modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, we  need to model 
your data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries that are given in the project template.

## **Datasets:**
For this project, you'll be working with one dataset: event_data. The directory of CSV files partitioned by date which is present in
the workspace.

## **Project Template:**
The project template includes one Jupyter Notebook file, in which:

1. Process the event_datafile_new.csv dataset to create a denormalized dataset
2. Model the data tables keeping in mind the queries you need to run
3. Queries are provided and according to them one  needed to model  data tables.
4. Load the data into tables  created in Apache Cassandra and run the queries.
